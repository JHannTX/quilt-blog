<p>Welcome to Ele15 Quilts!</p>

<p>This is my blog that is mostly dedicated to quilting! There are/will be some posts about random thoughts in their dedicated section.  Most of the quilting posts will be about specific projects, with a seperate section breaking down techniques!  If you want to learn more about me, make sure to check out the about page.</p>

<p>This blog is still very much so a work in progress.</p>
